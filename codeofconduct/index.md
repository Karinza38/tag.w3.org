title: TAG Code of conduct
---

The TAG's primary focus is on the architecture of the World Wide Web, including general technical oversight of the development of the Web platform.

Our work includes:

 * **Recommendations** - On occasion, the TAG will produce a Recommendation-track document, such as the Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume 1. When appropriate, the TAG also liaises with W3C Working Groups to produce Recommendations.
 * **Findings** - Findings represent a TAG position on a single issue or area of interest.
 * **Reviews** - The TAG also reviews specifications in development, Working Group charters and other W3C technical materials.
 * **Documentation** - Finally, the TAG sometimes publishes non-normative documentation and guides.
 
See [our workspace page](https://github.com/w3ctag/) for a list of our current work items.

Our work items are tracked and developed in [Github](https://github.com/w3ctag/). If you have a specific issue with one of the documents the TAG is working on or has published, we encourage you to open an issue against that document on Github, or fork our work and send us a pull request.

We encourage requests for spec reviews to be posted as [issues to our Spec Reviews repository](https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues). Feedback on specific TAG deliverables should be posted as issues in the appropriate repository where that document is being developed.  Some discussions also take place on the [public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/).

Those who participate in discussions in any of our issue trackers or on our public mailing list must understand and adhere to the guidelines below.

* Our issue trackers are forums for the current and potential work items of the TAG. General Web architecture discussions and the like are not appropriate for these fora.  Please send more general discussion messages to our mailing list.

* Some issues may be better handled by a specific Working Group; if this is the case, we will ask for discussion to be moved there.

* The TAG determines what work items we adopt and approve; while we appreciate input from the public, we are under no obligation to adopt or approve any idea.

* TAG members will make reasonable efforts to read and respond to mailing list messages.

* Messages in mailing lists or trackers may cause notifications to thousands of busy people, so please keep them brief and on-topic. Refrain from sending long stories, aphorisms, etc., even if you feel that they bolster your argument.

* Please keep messages focused and concise, be polite and respectful of fellow contributors and TAG members. Understand others' perspectives, be prepared to change your view in response to compelling evidence, and avoid becoming combative, frustrated or passive aggressive.  TAG members will be respectful of anyone who engages with us, and we expect the same in return.  We are also bound by the [W3C Code of professional ethics](https://github.com/w3ctag/w3ctag.github.io/blob/master/about/tagcodeofconduct.md)

* We reserve the right to ban those who persistently post off-topic messages, unsolicited commercial e-mail, those who are disrespectful of others, and those we consider to be “trolls.”

* TAG consensus positions are arrived at during our [minuted meetings](https://github.com/w3ctag/meetings).
